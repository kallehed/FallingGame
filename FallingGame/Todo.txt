Add matrix to convert coordinates correctly
Add player which will fall

Bounce inner-workings: 
Player is a Y-Position and a width(bottom of bird). Bouncers are Y-Position and width.
If ( P_y was higher than B_y PREVIOUS frame, but lower in CURERNT frame 
AND P_x+w intersects B_x+w in CURRENT frame ) ====> BOUNCE!
ALSO: possible y_vel must be low enough 

// bouncing seems to work with delta-time correctly as of now

Long level with switching environments that become more difficult, earn coins, get upgrades

Clouds have Z-axis their y movement and size depends on this. Background moves the least, is picture that is stretched

Background gets increasingly darker as thunder clouds get closer. Til you lose

Bounce in x based on x-offset to bouncer
